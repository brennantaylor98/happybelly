## Title :
### Bootcamp Group Project 1

## Project :
### *Happy Belly*

## Description :
* This is a group project created using HTML, CSS, and server-side APIs
*  The frontend also uses Foundation, Bootstrap, and JQuery framework for the styling
* Happy Belly is a user application that produces recipes within a calorie range specified by the user

## Working :
- Enter user's BMI information into the BMI calculator
- Click the "Find Recipes" to search for recipes within a user's specified calorie range
- Enter user's specified calorie range on the "Search for Recipes" page and then click the "Search for Recipes" button to generate recipes that fall within the caloric range specified by user

## Usage :
- Open the index.html in the browser and the initial interface of the application will appear, then user inputs their weight and height into the BMI calculator
- Based on the user's BMI calculation, an appropriate calorie range that meets their dietary goals will be determined 
- Given the recommended calorie range, the user can search for recipes that meet their caloric intake recommendations on the "Search for Recipes" page, linked from the main page

## User Story :
- As a dieter, I want to easily find recipes that meet the recommended caloric intake minimum and maximum of my diet plan
- So that I can successfully follow my diet plan in a sustainable way

## Acceptance Criteria :
- Given I open the Happy Belly application, then I am prompted with a web page that displays a container for me to enter in my BMI specifications
- When I enter in my specifications
- Then I am prompted with a fetched API that displays whether I am underweight, on weight, or overweight
- When I click the "Find Recipes" button
- Then I am prompted with a page for me to enter my desired calorie intake
- When the "Search for Recipes" button is pressed
- Then I am prompted with a page that displays nine recipes within my caloric specifications 
- When I click on the name of one of the displayed recipes
- Then I am redirected to a page that displays the recipe guide
